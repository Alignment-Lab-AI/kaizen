# CloudCode

CloudCode is an open-source project that helps teams ensure quality in their software delivery by providing a suite of tools for code review, test generation, and end-to-end testing. It integrates with your existing code repositories and workflows, allowing you to streamline your software development process.

## Features

### Code Review

CloudCode automatically reviews pull requests, summarizing code changes, and providing insightful feedback on potential issues or areas of improvement. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand the context and implications of the code changes.

### End-to-End Testing

CloudCode generates comprehensive end-to-end tests based on your application's code and documentation. These tests ensure that your application functions correctly from start to finish, catching regressions and edge cases that may have been overlooked during development.

### RAGify

CloudCode RAGifies your code repositories, generating relevant context and allowing you to integrate your own Large Language Models (LLMs) or use pre-trained models. This feature enables you to leverage the power of LLMs for various tasks, such as code generation, documentation, and more.
