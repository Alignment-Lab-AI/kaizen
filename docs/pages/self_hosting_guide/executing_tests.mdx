Once you have generated all the necessary tests, you can run all the tests in two ways:

1. Run the following command to execute the tests (Say you want to execute end to end tests for your website).
 ```bash copy
    PYTHONPATH=. 
    poetry run python examples/e2e_test/execute.py
```

OR

2. Use the default pytest module to execute all tests.
```bash copy
    pytest -v .kaizen/ui_test/
```
  
 Kaizen will generate all the tests and store them inside `.kaizen/ui-test/`
