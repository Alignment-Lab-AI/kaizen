Once you have generated all the necessary tests, you can run all the tests in two ways:

1. Run the following command to execute the tests.
 ```bash copy
    PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/basic/execute.py
```

OR

2. Use the default pytest module to execute all tests.
```bash copy
    pytest -v .kaizen/tests/
```
  
 Kaizen will generate all the tests and store them inside `.kaizen/tests/`
