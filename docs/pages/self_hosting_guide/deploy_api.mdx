To deploy the Kaizen API using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the Kaizen project directory:

```bash copy
cd kaizen
```

3. Run the following command to start the API server and its dependencies using Docker Compose:

```bash copy
docker-compose up
```

This command will build and launch the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file. The API server for Kaizen will be deployed and accessible based on the configurations specified in the docker-compose.yml file.

You can monitor the logs and access the API endpoints once the containers are up and running. Use Ctrl + C to stop the Docker Compose process when you're finished.
