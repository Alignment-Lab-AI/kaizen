## How to Integrate Azure OpenAI with Kaizen?  
   
This post addresses a great question raised by Edwin regarding the integration of Azure OpenAI with Kaizen. Let's dive into the steps needed to make this integration work seamlessly.  
   
### Step 1: Set Environment Variables  
   
First, you need to add the necessary environment variables in your `.env` file. These variables are essential for authenticating and interacting with the Azure OpenAI service.  
   
```python  
os.environ["AZURE_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY>"  
os.environ["AZURE_API_BASE"] = "<YOUR_AZURE_API_BASE_URL>"  
os.environ["AZURE_API_VERSION"] = "<YOUR_AZURE_API_VERSION>"  
```  
   
Replace `<YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY>`, `<YOUR_AZURE_API_BASE_URL>`, and `<YOUR_AZURE_API_VERSION>` with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials.  
   
### Step 2: Update `config.json`  
   
Next, update your `config.json` file to include the model configuration for Azure. This configuration will specify which model deployment to use and the associated costs per token.  
   
```json  
{  
  ...  
  "model_config": {  
    "model": "azure/<NAME-OF-DEPLOYMENT>",  
    "input_cost_per_token": 0.000005,  
    "output_cost_per_token": 0.000015  
  },  
  ...  
}  
```  
   
Replace `<NAME-OF-DEPLOYMENT>` with the name of your Azure OpenAI deployment.  
   
### Conclusion  
   
By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Azure OpenAI with Kaizen. This setup allows you to utilize Azure's powerful language models within your Kaizen projects efficiently.
