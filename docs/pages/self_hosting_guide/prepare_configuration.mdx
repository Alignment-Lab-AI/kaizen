To prepare for deployment, follow these steps to configure the necessary files:

1. **Copy Environment File**:  
Create a `.env` file by duplicating `.env.example`. This file will store environment variables required for the deployment process. Add the values of the key and base you are using based on your LLM.

2. **Set the Environment Variables Values in your System**:

**Mac/Linux**
   ```bash
   export VARIABLE_NAME="value"
   ```

   **Windows**
   ```bash
   setx VARIABLE_NAME "value"
   ```


3. **Store GitHub App PEM File**:  
Ensure the PEM file for the GitHub app is stored as `GITHUB_APP_KEY.pem` within the Kaizen root path. This file is necessary for authentication and interaction with the GitHub platform during deployment.

### Configuring Features

You can adjust additional features by modifying the `config.json` file. This JSON file controls specific configurations related to the deployment process and application behavior.

Note : Make sure to update these files appropriately before proceeding with deployment. Check whether the Environment variables are actually defined properly.
