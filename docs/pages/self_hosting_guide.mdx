This guide outlines the steps to set up a self-hosted instance of CloudCode, which utilizes a GitHub App to perform various actions related to pull requests (PRs) and repository management.  

CloudCode allows you to run its API server locally or on your own infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your system:

- **Git**: Version control system used to clone the CloudCode repository.
- **Python**: Required for using Poetry, a dependency manager used by CloudCode.
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: For deploying and managing containerized applications.
- **GitHub Account**: You'll need this to set up a GitHub App and configure permissions.

## Outline

To create your own local version of CloudCode, follow along the guide to complete the following steps:

1. [Clone the repository.](self_hosting_guide/clone_repository)
2. [Install required dependencies.](self_hosting_guide/install_dependencies)
3. [Create a Github app.](self_hosting_guide/setup_github_app)
4. [Prepare the configuration settings.](self_hosting_guide/prepare_configuration)
