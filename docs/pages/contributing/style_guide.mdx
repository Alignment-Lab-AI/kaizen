# Style Guide

To ensure consistency across the project, we follow these style guidelines:

## Code Style

- We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Please ensure your code is formatted before submitting a PR.
- We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JavaScript code.

## Commit Messages

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf:` for code changes that improve performance
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` for changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Documentation Style

- Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for documentation files.
- Keep language clear and concise.
- Use code blocks for examples.
- Include links to relevant sections or external resources.

## CSS/SCSS

- Use kebab-case for class names (e.g., `.my-class-name`).
- Avoid using IDs for styling.
- Use variables for colors, fonts, and other repeated values.

Remember, these guidelines are here to help maintain consistency, but they're not set in stone. If you have a good reason to deviate from them, please explain in your pull request.
