You can start using Cloud Code AI in two different ways:

## Cloud Hosted Solution (Recommended) 
Utilize our cloud-hosted, scalable application at [https://beta.cloudcode.ai](https://beta.cloudcode.ai) to quickly access and leverage Cloud Code AI's capabilities without setting up your own infrastructure. This option is ideal for immediate use and simplifies the deployment process.

## Self-Hosted Deployment 
Deploy your own instance of the open-source Cloud Code project by following the installation instructions provided in our documentation. Follow the steps outlined in the [installation guide](self_hosting_guide) to set up Cloud Code AI on your infrastructure.

Choose the option that best fits your needs and start accelerating your software development with Cloud Code AI today!

## Getting Started

To get started with Kaizen, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd kaizen
   poetry install
   ```

3. Generate tests for your website:

    First, you need to update the URL in the `examples/basic/generate.py`
    ```bash
      PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/basic/generate.py
    ```
  
    Kaizen will generate all the tests and store them inside `.kaizen/tests/`

4. Execute tests:

    Once you have generated all the necessary tests, you can run all the tests in two ways:
    ```bash
      PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/basic/execute.py
    ```

    Or using the default pytest module:
   ```
     pytest -v .kaizen/tests/
   ```
  
    Kaizen will generate all the tests and store them inside `.kaizen/tests/`
