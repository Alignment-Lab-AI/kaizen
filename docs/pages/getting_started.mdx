You can start using Cloud Code AI in two different ways:

## Cloud Hosted Solution (Recommended) 
Utilize our cloud-hosted, scalable application at [https://beta.cloudcode.ai](https://beta.cloudcode.ai) to quickly access and leverage Cloud Code AI's capabilities without setting up your own infrastructure. This option is ideal for immediate use and simplifies the deployment process.

## Self-Hosted Deployment 
Deploy your own instance of the open-source Cloud Code project by following the installation instructions provided in our documentation. Follow the steps outlined in the [installation guide](self_hosting_guide) to set up Cloud Code AI on your infrastructure.
