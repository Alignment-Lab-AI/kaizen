## Code Scanner

The Code Scanner feature is powered by kaizen and provides comprehensive static code analysis to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement in your codebase.

### How it Works:
- Input your source code or provide access to your repository.
- The Code Scanner employs advanced algorithms and AI to analyze the code and generate a detailed report of findings.

You can find an example [here](https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/tree/main/examples/code_scan)

### Using the Code Scanner:
- Submit your code or repository for analysis.
- Trigger the Code Scanner to perform a thorough examination.
- Review the generated report highlighting issues, potential bugs, and suggestions for improvement.

### Benefits:
- Early Bug Detection
- Security Vulnerability Identification
- Code Quality Improvement
- Coding Standard Enforcement
- Technical Debt Reduction

### Limitations:
- False Positives: Some identified issues may not be actual problems in certain contexts.
- Language Coverage: Effectiveness may vary depending on programming language and framework.

The Code Scanner utilizes AI and static analysis techniques to enhance code quality, security, and maintainability, supporting a proactive approach to software development and maintenance.
