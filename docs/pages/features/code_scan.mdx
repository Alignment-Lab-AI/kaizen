## Code Scanner

Comprehensive static code analysis to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement in your codebase.

### Key Features

1. **Static Analysis**: The feature performs in-depth analysis of your code to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.

2. **Multi-language Support**: Code Scanner can analyze code in various programming languages and frameworks.

3. **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports highlighting issues, potential bugs, and suggestions for improvement.

4. **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

5. **Code Quality Metrics**: Provides metrics and insights on code quality and maintainability.

### How it Works

- Input your source code or provide access to your repository.
- The Code Scanner employs advanced algorithms and AI to analyze the code and generate a detailed report of findings.
- The scanner identifies potential issues, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement in your codebase.

## Usage Guide

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use the Code Scanner:

1. Follow the initial setup guide [here](../initial_setup_guide).

2. Create a new Python file and import the necessary modules from Kaizen:

   ```python
    from kaizen.reviewer.code_scan import CodeScanner
    from kaizen.llms.provider import LLMProvider
    import json
   ```

3. Create an instance of the CodeScanner:  


   ```python
   reviewer = CodeScanner(llm_provider=LLMProvider())
   ```

4. Provide the source code file or directory path which you want to scan: 

   You can scan a single file at a time:

   ```python
    filename = "path/to/your/file.py"
    with open(filename, "r+") as f:
        file_data = f.read()
    review_data = reviewer.review_code(file_data=file_data, user="YourUsername/ProjectName")
   ```

   Or a whole directory:

   ```python
    dir_path = "path/to/your/directory/"
    review_data = reviewer.review_code_dir(
        dir_path=dir_path, reevaluate=True, user="YourUsername/ProjectName"
    )
   ```

5. Display the test results:

   ```python
    print(f"Total {len(review_data.issues)} Issues found!!!!")
    print(json.dumps(review_data.issues, indent=2))
   ```
6. Review the generated report and address the identified issues in your code.

### Example

Here's a complete example to generate unit tests for a specific file:

```python
    from kaizen.reviewer.code_scan import CodeScanner
    from kaizen.llms.provider import LLMProvider
    import json

    # Create an instance of the CodeScanner
    reviewer = CodeScanner(llm_provider=LLMProvider())

    # Scan a single file
    filename = "github_app/main.py"
    with open(filename, "r+") as f:
        file_data = f.read()
    review_data = reviewer.review_code(file_data=file_data, user="Example/CodeScan")

    # Scan a whole directory
    dir_path = "github_app/"
    review_data = reviewer.review_code_dir(
        dir_path=dir_path, reevaluate=True, user="Example/CodeScan"
    )

    # Display the results
    print(f"Total {len(review_data.issues)} Issues found!!!!")
    print(json.dumps(review_data.issues, indent=2))
```

### Supported Languages

- All programming languages

## Benefits

- Early Bug Detection
- Security Vulnerability Identification
- Code Quality Improvement
- Coding Standard Enforcement
- Technical Debt Reduction

## Limitations

- False Positives: Some identified issues may not be actual problems in certain contexts.
- Language Coverage: Effectiveness may vary depending on programming language and framework.
- AI Limitations: May not catch all possible issues or understand complex project-specific requirements.
