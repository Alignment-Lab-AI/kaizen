## UI Reviewer

AI-powered analysis and feedback for improving user experience and accessibility of UI components.

### Key Features

1. **UI Component Analysis**: The feature analyzes HTML code of UI components to identify areas for improvement.

2. **UX Feedback**: Provides actionable feedback to enhance user experience.

3. **Accessibility Evaluation**: Identifies accessibility issues and suggests improvements for better compliance.

4. **Organized Reporting**: Generates feedback in a structured JSON format for easy interpretation and implementation.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Supports iterative development by providing ongoing feedback as UI evolves.


### How it Works

- Input your HTML code or URL for which you want to generate UI reviews.
- The UI Reviewer leverages advanced language models to analyze the code and generate a detailed report of findings.
- The scanner identifies potential issues, accessibility issues, and areas for improvement in your UI.

## Usage Guide

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use the UI Reviewer:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   **Mac/Linux**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install poetry and Kaizen:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry kaizen-cloudcode
   ```
3. Create a new Python file and import the necessary modules from Kaizen:

   ```python
    from kaizen.reviewer.ui_review import UIReviewer
    import json
   ```
4. Create an instance of the UI Reviewer:  

   ```python
   ui_review = UIReviewer()
   ```

5. Provide the URL or HTML code for which you want to generate UI reviews:
   
   UI review for a specific URL:
   ```python
    url = "https://cloudcode.ai"
    reviews = ui_review.generate_ui_review(url=url)["reviews"]
   ```

   UI review for HTML code:
   ```python
    html_code = """
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to CloudCode.ai</h1>
        <p>This is a sample HTML code for UI review.</p>
    </div>
    """
    reviews = ui_review.generate_ui_review(html_code=html_code)["reviews"]
   ```

6. Display the test results:

   ```python
    print_block = """
    -----------------------------------------------
    Topic: {topic}
    Review: {review}
    Confidence: {confidence}
    Solution: {solution}
    Code Block:
    ```html
    {code_block}
    ```\n\n
    """

    for review in reviews:
        content = print_block.format(
            topic=review["topic"],
            review=review["comment"],
            confidence=review["confidence"],
            code_block=review["code_block"],
            solution=review["solution"],
        )
        print(content)
    ```
7. Review the generated report and address the identified issues in your code.

### Example

Here's a complete example to review the UI of a specific URL:

```python
from kaizen.reviewer.ui_review import UIReviewer

# Create an instance of the UI Reviewer
ui_review = UIReviewer()

# Generate UI review for a specific URL
url = "https://cloudcode.ai"
reviews = ui_review.generate_ui_review(url=url)["reviews"]

# Display the results
print_block = """
-----------------------------------------------
Topic: {topic}
Review: {review}
Confidence: {confidence}
Solution: {solution}
Code Block:
```html
{code_block}
```\n\n
"""

for review in reviews:
    content = print_block.format(
        topic=review["topic"],
        review=review["comment"],
        confidence=review["confidence"],
        code_block=review["code_block"],
        solution=review["solution"],
    )
    print(content)
```

### Supported Input
