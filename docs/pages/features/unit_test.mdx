## Unit Test Generator

The Unit Test Generator feature is powered by kaizen and automatically creates comprehensive unit tests for your code, improving code quality and test coverage.

### How it Works:
- Input the source code for which you want to generate unit tests.
- The Unit Test Generator leverages advanced language models to analyze the code and generate appropriate unit tests in a format compatible with popular testing frameworks.

You can find an example [here](https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/tree/main/examples/unittest/main.py)

### Using the Unit Test Generator:
- Provide the source code or filename for which you want to generate unit tests.
- [Optional] Setup Github App to Trigger the Unit Test Generator to receive automatically created unit tests.
- Review and integrate the generated tests into your test suite.

### Benefits:
- Increased Test Coverage
- Time Efficiency
- Consistency in Testing
- Early Bug Detection

### Limitations:
- AI Limitations: May not cover all edge cases or complex scenarios.
- Human Oversight: Generated tests should be reviewed and potentially modified by developers.

The Unit Test Generator uses AI to enhance the testing process, improve code quality, and streamline the development workflow by automating the creation of unit tests.
