## Code Reviewer

Automatically get reviews and feedback on code changes in your pull requests on GitHub.  
Streamline code reviews and ensure high code quality commit messages across your codebase.

### Key Features

1. **Automated Code Analysis**: Analyzes code changes in pull requests and generates detailed feedback.

2. **Organized Feedback**: Provides review comments organized by topics and confidence levels.

3. **Interactive Reviews**: Allows engagement with the bot for clarification or additional context.

4. **PR Description Generation**: Automatically generates descriptive summaries of code changes.

5. **Continuous Learning**: Improves review quality over time based on user interactions.

### How it Works

1. **Diff Analysis**: When you create or update a pull request, the Kaizen Bot analyzes the code changes (diff) and generates detailed feedback based on the modified code snippets.

2. **Organized Feedback**: The bot's feedback is organized into topics or categories like performance, security, code style, or documentation, making it easier to navigate and prioritize the comments.

3. **Confidence Levels**: Each review comment includes a confidence level (critical, high, medium, low), indicating the perceived importance or severity of the issue.

4. **Contextual Information**: The reviews provide context-specific details like file names, line numbers, code snippets, and explanations for the suggested changes.

5. **PR Description Generation**: The bot can generate a descriptive summary of the code changes, helping you better document your pull requests.

## Usage Guide

1. **Getting Started**: For a quickstart you can use the cloud hosted web application that we provide by following [this](../cloud_platform/getting_started). You can also choose to self host the Kaizen Github Bot locally by following the advanced guide [here](../self_hosting_guide).  
The next given steps explore the latter approach in details.
2. **Create or Update a Pull Request**: The Kaizen Bot will automatically analyze the code changes and generate a review.
3. **Review the Feedback**: The bot's feedback will be shared as a comment on your pull request, organized by topics and confidence levels.
4. **Engage with the Bot**: You can interact with the bot, provide additional context, or request clarification on its feedback.
5. **Iterate and Improve**: As you work with the bot, it will learn from your responses and improve the quality of its reviews over time.

### Example

Here's a complete example to review a pull request:

```python
from kaizen.reviewer.code_review import CodeReviewer
from kaizen.generator.pr_description import PRDescriptionGenerator
from kaizen.llms.provider import LLMProvider
from github_app.github_helper.utils import get_diff_text, get_pr_files
from github_app.github_helper.pull_requests import clean_keys, create_review_comments
from kaizen.formatters.code_review_formatter import create_pr_review_text
import json
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level="DEBUG")

# Pull request information
pr_diff = "https://github.com/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/pull/335.patch"
pr_files = "https://api.github.com/repos/Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen/pulls/335/files"
pr_title = "feat: updated the prompt to provide solution"

# Get diff text and PR files
diff_text = get_diff_text(pr_diff, "")
pr_files = get_pr_files(pr_files, "")

# Create CodeReviewer instance
reviewer = CodeReviewer(llm_provider=LLMProvider())

# Review pull request
review_data = reviewer.review_pull_request(
    diff_text=diff_text,
    pull_request_title=pr_title,
    pull_request_desc="",
    pull_request_files=pr_files,
    reeval_response=False,
)

# Process review data
topics = clean_keys(review_data.topics, "important")
review_desc = create_pr_review_text(
    review_data.issues, code_quality=review_data.code_quality
)
comments, topics = create_review_comments(topics)

# Display results
print(f"Raw Topics:\n{json.dumps(topics, indent=2)}\n")
print(f"GENERATED REVIEW:\n{review_desc}")
print(f"\nComment and topics:\n{json.dumps(comments, indent=2)},\n{topics}")

# Generate PR description
print("---------------Generate desc-------------")
pr_desc = PRDescriptionGenerator(llm_provider=LLMProvider())
desc_data = pr_desc.generate_pull_request_desc(
    diff_text=None,
    pull_request_title=pr_title,
    pull_request_desc="",
    pull_request_files=pr_files,
    user="kaizen/example",
)
print(desc_data)
```

### Supported Input

- GitHub pull request information (diff, files, title, description)

## Benefits

- Improved Code Quality
- Time Savings
- Consistent Standards
- Knowledge Sharing
- Automated Documentation

## Limitations

- AI Limitations: While advanced, the bot may still have limitations in understanding complex code or context-specific nuances.
- Human Oversight: The bot's feedback should be considered a complementary tool to human code reviews, not a complete replacement.
- GitHub API Limitations: Rate limits and authentication requirements may affect large-scale usage.
