## E2E UI Test Generator

Streamline the process of creating and maintaining comprehensive end-to-end tests for web applications using the Playwright testing framework.  
Generate robust and maintainable test scripts that can be seamlessly integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

### Key Features:

1. **Test Plan Generation**: The feature analyzes the application requirements or specifications and automatically generates a comprehensive test plan, covering various user flows and scenarios.

2. **Playwright Test Script Generation**: Based on the test plan, the feature generates Playwright test scripts written in Python 3.9, following best practices and industry standards.

3. **Page Object Model**: The generated scripts implement the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

4. **Web Element Interaction**: The scripts leverage Playwright's powerful features for interacting with web elements, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating between pages.

5. **Visual Testing**: The feature utilizes Playwright's capabilities to capture screenshots and videos during test execution, enabling visual validation and debugging.

## Usage Guide:

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use the E2E UI Test Generator:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   **Mac/Linux**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install poetry and Kaizen:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry kaizen-cloudcode
   ```

3. Create a new Python file and import the E2ETestGenerator module:

   ```python
   from kaizen.generator.e2e_tests import E2ETestGenerator
   ```

4. Create an instance of the E2ETestGenerator:

   ```python
   generator = E2ETestGenerator()
   ```

5. Generate E2E tests for a specific URL:

   ```python
   WEBPAGE_URL = "https://example.com"
   tests, * = generator.generate_e2e_tests(WEBPAGE_URL)
   ```

6. Display the generated tests:

   ```python
   for test in tests:
       print(f'Module Title: {test["module_title"]} || Importance: {test["importance"]}')
       for t in test["tests"]:
           print(f'Description: {t["test_description"]}')
           print(f'Code: \n{t["code"]}')
           print("-----------------------------------------------------------")
   ```

7. Run the generated tests:

   ```python
   results = generator.run_tests()
   print(f"Test Execution results: \n {results}")
   ```

8. Review the generated tests and execution results, and integrate them into your development workflow.

### Example:

Here's a complete example to generate and run E2E UI tests:

```python
from kaizen.generator.e2e_tests import E2ETestGenerator
import time
import sys
import traceback

# Create an instance of the E2E Test Generator
generator = E2ETestGenerator()

# Set the webpage URL to test
WEBPAGE_URL = "https://cloudcode.ai"

print(f"Generating UI tests for `{WEBPAGE_URL}`, please wait...")
start_time = time.time()

try:
    # Generate E2E tests
    tests, * = generator.generate_e2e_tests(WEBPAGE_URL)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print(traceback.format_exc())
    sys.exit(1)

end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"\nUI tests generated in {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds.")

# Display generated tests
for test in tests:
    print(
        f'#### ======== Module Title: {test["module_title"]} || Importance: {test["importance"]} ========== ####'
    )
    for t in test["tests"]:
        print(f'Desc: {t["test_description"]}')
        print(f'Code: \n{t["code"]}')
        print("-----------------------------------------------------------")

# Run the generated tests
results = generator.run_tests()
print(f"Test Execution results: \n {results}")
```

To execute the generated tests:

```python
import pytest

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_dir = ".kaizen/tests"
    pytest.main(
        [
            "--timeout=60",
            "-v",
            test_dir,
        ]
    )
```

### Supported Frameworks:

- Playwright

## How it Works:

- Provide the URL of the web application you want to test.
- The E2E UI Test Generator analyzes the web application's content and structure.
- It generates comprehensive Playwright test scripts covering various UI modules and user flows.
- The generated scripts can be executed locally or integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

## API Reference:

### Class: E2ETestGenerator

#### Constructor

- `__init__(self)`
  Initializes the E2ETestGenerator.

#### Methods

##### generate_e2e_tests

- `generate_e2e_tests(self, url: str) -> Tuple[List[Dict], Dict]`
  Generates E2E UI tests for the given URL.
