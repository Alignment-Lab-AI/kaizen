Welcome to the Cloud Code AI documentation! This resource will guide you through utilizing Cloud Code AI to enhance your software development journey â€” from code reviews and testing automation to ensuring the security and reliability of your applications.

## About Cloud Code AI

Cloud Code AI is an AI-driven platform designed to empower development teams by automating critical aspects of the software development lifecycle. Our suite of tools helps streamline code reviews, generate robust test cases, and ensure end-to-end functionality for your applications.

## Key Features

- #### Code Review
    CloudCode automatically reviews pull requests, summarizing code changes, and providing insightful feedback on potential issues or areas of improvement. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand the context and implications of the code changes.

- #### End-to-End Testing  
    CloudCode generates comprehensive end-to-end tests based on your application's code and documentation. These tests ensure that your application functions correctly from start to finish, catching regressions and edge cases that may have been overlooked during development.

- #### RAGify  
    CloudCode RAGifies your code repositories, generating relevant context and allowing you to integrate your own Large Language Models (LLMs) or use pre-trained models. This feature enables you to leverage the power of LLMs for various tasks, such as code generation, documentation, and more. the code review process with AI-driven insights and feedback.
