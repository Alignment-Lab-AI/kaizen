### Home Page Class
Create the `home_page.py` file in the `pages` directory:

```python
# pages/home_page.py
from playwright.sync_api import Page

class HomePage:
    def __init__(self, page: Page):
        self.page = page
        self.book_demo_button_selector = 'button:has-text("Book a Demo")'

    def navigate(self, url: str):
        self.page.goto(url)

    def click_book_demo(self):
        self.page.click(self.book_demo_button_selector)
```

### Test Script
Create the `test_book_a_demo.py` file in the `tests` directory:

```python
# tests/test_book_a_demo.py
import pytest
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from pages.home_page import HomePage

@pytest.mark.parametrize("url", ["https://cloudcode.ai"])
def test_book_a_demo(url):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)  # Set headless to True for headless mode
        context = browser.new_context()
        page = context.new_page()
        home_page = HomePage(page)

        # Navigate to the home page
        home_page.navigate(url)

        # Click the 'Book a Demo' button
        home_page.click_book_demo()

        # Add assertions here to verify the expected outcome
        # For example, check if the URL changed or a modal appeared
        assert page.url == "EXPECTED_URL_AFTER_CLICK"  # Replace with the actual expected URL

        # Optionally take a screenshot for verification
        page.screenshot(path="screenshot_book_demo.png")

        # Close the browser context
        context.close()
        browser.close()
```
