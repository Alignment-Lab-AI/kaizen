### Key Features of the Script

1. **Headless Mode**: The browser is launched in headless mode for CI/CD compatibility.
2. **Page Object Model**: The `MovingDotPage` class encapsulates the functionality related to the moving dot, promoting reusability.
3. **Element Interaction**: The script interacts with the moving dot and captures its position before and after the expected animation.
4. **Assertions**: It asserts that the dot has moved, ensuring the functionality works as expected.
5. **Screenshots**: A screenshot is captured for verification purposes.
6. **Comments**: The code includes comments for clarity and maintainability.

### Documentation

# Playwright Test for Moving Dot Feature

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed.
2. Install Playwright:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```

## Running the Test

1. Navigate to the directory containing `test_moving_dot.py`.
2. Run the test:
   ```bash
   python test_moving_dot.py
   ```

## CI/CD Integration

- Ensure the test script is included in your CI/CD pipeline.
- The test can be executed in headless mode, making it suitable for automated environments.

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and update the test as the application evolves.
- Collaborate with developers to ensure the tests align with application updates.
