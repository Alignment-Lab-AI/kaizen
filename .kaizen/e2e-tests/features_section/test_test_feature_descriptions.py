### Step 2: Create Page Object Model (POM)

Create a file named `cloudcode_page.py` in a `page_objects` directory:

```python
# page_objects/cloudcode_page.py
from playwright.async_api import Page

class CloudCodePage:
    def __init__(self, page: Page):
        self.page = page

    async def navigate(self, url: str):
        await self.page.goto(url)

    async def get_feature_descriptions(self):
        return await self.page.locator("div#features h3").all_inner_texts()
```

### Step 3: Write the Test Script

Create a file named `test_feature_descriptions.py` in a `tests` directory:

```python
# tests/test_feature_descriptions.py
import pytest
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from page_objects.cloudcode_page import CloudCodePage

# Expected feature descriptions
EXPECTED_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "Seamless Integration": "With popular development environments and CI/CD pipelines",
    "Increased Data Privacy": "Compared to enterprise LLMs, our custom models are not trained on user data, allowing for a maximum of data privacy",
    "Continuous Improvement": "True to its name, Kaizen learns from each interaction, becoming smarter and more effective",
    "Open Source Flexibility": "We invite contributions from the global developer community to accelerate innovation",
    "One Click Generation": "Generate tests and perform code reviews with a single click by simply providing your source code or URL",
    "No Data Retention": "No code or logs stored. Only anonymized telemetry and essential webhook data retained for maintenance, never used for training.",
    "Convenient Q&A Support": "Tag @cloud-code-ai with a question, right from a GitHub comment or use our integrated live chat",
    "Python, JS/TS": "The platform currently supports Python, JavaScript and TypeScript models."
}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_feature_descriptions():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        cloud_code_page = CloudCodePage(page)

        await cloud_code_page.navigate("https://cloudcode.ai")

        # Get actual feature descriptions
        actual_descriptions = await cloud_code_page.get_feature_descriptions()

        # Validate descriptions
        for description in actual_descriptions:
            assert description in EXPECTED_DESCRIPTIONS, f"Unexpected feature description: {description}"
            assert EXPECTED_DESCRIPTIONS[description] == description, f"Description mismatch for {description}"

        await page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")  # Capture screenshot on success
        await browser.close()
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

Execute the test script using pytest:
```bash
pytest tests/test_feature_descriptions.py
