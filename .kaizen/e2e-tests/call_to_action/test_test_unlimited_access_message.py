### Step 1: Implement the Page Object Model

**File: `home_page.py`**
```python
from playwright.sync_api import Page

class HomePage:
    def __init__(self, page: Page):
        self.page = page
        self.unlimited_access_selector = "text=Enjoy Unlimited Access"

    def navigate(self, url: str):
        self.page.goto(url)

    def is_unlimited_access_message_displayed(self):
        return self.page.is_visible(self.unlimited_access_selector)
```

### Step 2: Write the Test Script

**File: `test_unlimited_access.py`**
```python
import pytest
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from page_objects.home_page import HomePage

@pytest.mark.parametrize("url", ["https://cloudcode.ai"])
def test_unlimited_access_message(url):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)  # Set headless=True for CI/CD
        context = browser.new_context()
        
        # Optional: Enable video recording
        # context = browser.new_context(record_video={"dir": "videos/", "size": {"width": 1280, "height": 720}})

        page = context.new_page()
        
        home_page = HomePage(page)
        home_page.navigate(url)

        assert home_page.is_unlimited_access_message_displayed(), "Unlimited access message is not displayed."

        # Capture a screenshot for debugging
        page.screenshot(path='unlimited_access_message.png')

        context.close()
        browser.close()
```

### Step 3: Run the Test
To run the test, navigate to your project directory and execute the following command:
```bash
pytest tests/test_unlimited_access.py
```

### Step 4: CI/CD Integration
Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline includes the following commands to install Playwright and run the tests:
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
pytest tests/test_unlimited_access.py
```

### Step 5: Documentation
Create a `README.md` file in the project root with the following content:

```markdown
