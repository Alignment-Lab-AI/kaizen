## 🚨 Critical Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Error Handling (3 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. API call may fail without a retry mechanism.
📁 **File:** `main.py:66`
⚖️ **Severity:** 8/10
🔍 **Description:** The completion function call does not handle potential API failures.
💡 **Solution:** Implement a retry mechanism or error handling for API calls.

**Current Code:**
```python
response = completion(
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
# Implement retry logic here
```

### 2. Silent failure without logging in case of JSON parsing error.
📁 **File:** `main.py:86`
⚖️ **Severity:** 7/10
🔍 **Description:** The code does not log the error, making debugging difficult.
💡 **Solution:** Log the error message to provide feedback in case of failure.

**Current Code:**
```python
print(f"Failed to parse content for applicant")
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
print(f"Failed to parse content for applicant:{e}")
```

### 3. Potential division by zero error.
📁 **File:** `main.py:159`
⚖️ **Severity:** 9/10
🔍 **Description:** If total_tokens is zero, this will raise an error.
💡 **Solution:** Add a check to prevent division by zero.

**Current Code:**
```python
print(f"Total tokens used:{total_tokens:,}")
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
if total_tokens > 0: print(f"Total tokens used:{total_tokens:,}")
```

## 🟠 Refinement Suggestions:
These are not critical issues, but addressing them could further improve the code:

<details>
<summary><strong>Inefficient Progress Reporting (2 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Inefficient way to print progress.
📁 **File:** `main.py:121`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** The current method of printing progress can be improved for better performance.
💡 **Solution:** Consider using a logging library or a more efficient progress reporting method.

**Current Code:**
```python
print(f"\rProgress:[{('=' * int(50 * progress)):<50}]{progress:.0%}", end="", flush=True)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
# Use logging or a more efficient progress reporting
```

### 2. No error handling for file not found.
📁 **File:** `main.py:175`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** If the file does not exist, it will raise an unhandled exception.
💡 **Solution:** Add error handling to manage file not found scenarios.

**Current Code:**
```python
main(input_file)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
# Add error handling for file not found
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand (2 issues)</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Redundant Code (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Redundant check for empty DataFrame.
📁 **File:** `main.py:142`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** The check for an empty DataFrame is unnecessary as the process will handle it.
💡 **Solution:** Remove the redundant check to simplify the code.

**Current Code:**
```python
if len(df) == 0:
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```
