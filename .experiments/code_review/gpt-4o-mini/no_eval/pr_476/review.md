<details>
<summary><strong>Error Handling (4 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Broad exception handling can obscure specific errors.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:140`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Using a generic Exception can make debugging difficult and hide underlying issues.
💡 **Solution:** Catch specific exceptions where possible.

**Current Code:**
```python
except Exception:
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
except KeyError:
```

### 2. The function 'post_pull_request' has an additional parameter that should be documented.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:106`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** New parameters should be documented to ensure clarity for future maintainers.
💡 **Solution:** Update the function docstring to include the 'tests' parameter.

**Current Code:**
```python
def post_pull_request(url, data, installation_id, tests=None):
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
def post_pull_request(url, data, installation_id, tests=None):  # tests: List of test files
```

### 3. The new function 'sort_files' lacks a docstring.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:184`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Docstrings are essential for understanding the purpose and usage of functions.
💡 **Solution:** Add a docstring to describe the function's purpose and parameters.

**Current Code:**
```python
def sort_files(files):
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
def sort_files(files):  # Sorts a list of file dictionaries by filename.
```

### 4. Consider using logging instead of print statements for error reporting.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:141`
⚖️ **Severity:** 7/10
🔍 **Description:** Using logging allows for better control over the output and can be configured for different environments.
💡 **Solution:** Replace print statements with appropriate logging calls.

**Current Code:**
```python
print("Error")
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
logger.error("Error occurred")
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Variable Naming (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The variable 'tests' could be more descriptive.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:58`
⚖️ **Severity:** 3/10
🔍 **Description:** Descriptive variable names improve code readability and maintainability.
💡 **Solution:** Consider renaming 'tests' to 'generated_tests' for clarity.

```python
generated_tests = generate_tests(pr_files)
```
