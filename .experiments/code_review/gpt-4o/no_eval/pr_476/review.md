## 🚨 Critical Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Error Handling (2 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Generic exception handling without logging specific error details.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:140`
⚖️ **Severity:** 9/10
🔍 **Description:** Using a generic `except Exception` block without logging the specific error details can make debugging difficult.
💡 **Solution:** Log the specific error message in the exception block.

**Current Code:**
```python
except Exception:
    print("Error")
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error:{e}")
```

### 2. Changes made to sensitive file
📁 **File:** `config.json:1`
⚖️ **Severity:** 10/10
🔍 **Description:** Changes were made to config.json, which needs review
💡 **Solution:** NA

## 🟠 Refinement Suggestions:
These are not critical issues, but addressing them could further improve the code:

<details>
<summary><strong>Code Readability (2 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Unnecessary print statements left in the code.
📁 **File:** `examples/code_review/main.py:21`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Leaving print statements in production code can clutter the output and is generally not recommended.
💡 **Solution:** Remove or replace print statements with proper logging.

**Current Code:**
```python
print("diff: ", diff_text)
print("pr_files", pr_files)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

### 2. Modified function signature without updating all references.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:107`
⚖️ **Severity:** 7/10
🔍 **Description:** Changing a function signature without updating all references can lead to runtime errors.
💡 **Solution:** Ensure all references to `post_pull_request` are updated to include the new `tests` parameter.

**Current Code:**
```python
def post_pull_request(url, data, installation_id, tests=None):
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

<summary><strong>Code Maintainability (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Redundant code for sorting files.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:185`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** The custom sorting logic can be replaced with Python's built-in sorting functions for better readability and maintainability.
💡 **Solution:** Use Python's `sorted` function with a key parameter.

**Current Code:**
```python
sorted_files =[]
for file in files:
    min_index = len(sorted_files)
    file_name = file["filename"]
    for i, sorted_file in enumerate(sorted_files):
        if file_name < sorted_file["filename"]:
            min_index = i
            break
    sorted_files.insert(min_index, file)
return sorted_files
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
sorted_files = sorted(files, key=lambda x: x["filename"])
return sorted_files
```
