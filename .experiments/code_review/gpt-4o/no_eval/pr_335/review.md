## 🚨 Critical Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Function Parameters (2 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Removed `reeval_response` parameter from multiple functions. Ensure that this parameter is no longer needed and does not affect the functionality.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:43`
⚖️ **Severity:** 8/10
🔍 **Description:** Removing a parameter can lead to missing functionality if the parameter was being used elsewhere in the code.
💡 **Solution:** Verify that `reeval_response` is not required for the functions to operate correctly.

### 2. Changed the implementation of `_process_full_diff` to remove `reeval_response` logic. Ensure that the re-evaluation logic is no longer needed.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:79`
⚖️ **Severity:** 8/10
🔍 **Description:** Removing logic can lead to missing functionality if the logic was essential.
💡 **Solution:** Verify that the re-evaluation logic is not required for the function to operate correctly.

**Current Code:**
```python
resp, usage = self.provider.chat_completion(prompt, user=user)
desc = parser.extract_code_from_markdown(resp)
return desc
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

</details>

## 🟠 Refinement Suggestions:
These are not critical issues, but addressing them could further improve the code:

<details>
<summary><strong>Imports (3 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The import statement was changed to import from a different module. Ensure that the new module contains the required constants.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:8`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Changing import paths can lead to runtime errors if the new module does not contain the expected constants.
💡 **Solution:** Verify that `PR_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` exists in `pr_desc_prompts` and is correctly defined.

**Current Code:**
```python
from kaizen.llms.prompts.pr_desc_prompts import (
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

### 2. The system prompt was changed from `CODE_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to `PR_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Ensure this change aligns with the intended functionality.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:28`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Changing the system prompt can alter the behavior of the LLMProvider, potentially affecting the output.
💡 **Solution:** Confirm that `PR_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is the correct prompt for the intended functionality.

**Current Code:**
```python
self.provider.system_prompt = PR_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

### 3. Changed function calls to remove `reeval_response` parameter. Ensure that the new function signatures match the updated calls.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:52`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Mismatch in function signatures can lead to runtime errors.
💡 **Solution:** Ensure that `_process_full_diff` and `_process_files` functions do not require `reeval_response` parameter.

**Current Code:**
```python
desc = self._process_full_diff(prompt, user)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

## 📝 Minor Notes
Additional small points that you might want to consider:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand (1 issues)</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Prompt Definitions (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Added new prompt definitions in `pr_desc_prompts.py`. Ensure that these new prompts are correctly formatted and used in the code.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/llms/prompts/pr_desc_prompts.py:1`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** New prompt definitions need to be correctly formatted and integrated into the existing codebase.
💡 **Solution:** Review the new prompt definitions for correctness and ensure they are used appropriately.

**Current Code:**
```python
PR_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
