<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand (3 issues)</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code Structure (3 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The `generate_linkedin_post` method call has been split across multiple lines, which improves readability for long function calls.
📁 **File:** `examples/work_summarizer/main.py:60`
⚖️ **Severity:** 2/10
🔍 **Description:** Multi-line function calls can improve code readability, especially for functions with long parameter lists.
💡 **Solution:** The current implementation is good. No changes needed.

**Current Code:**
```python
linkedin_post = work_summary_generator.generate_linkedin_post(
    summary, user="oss_example"
)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python

```

### 2. The `generate_twitter_post` method call is not formatted consistently with the `generate_linkedin_post` call.
📁 **File:** `examples/work_summarizer/main.py:59`
⚖️ **Severity:** 3/10
🔍 **Description:** Consistent formatting improves code readability and maintainability.
💡 **Solution:** Consider formatting the `generate_twitter_post` call similarly to the `generate_linkedin_post` call for consistency.

**Current Code:**
```python
twitter_post = work_summary_generator.generate_twitter_post(summary, user="oss_example")
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
twitter_post = work_summary_generator.generate_twitter_post(
    summary, user="oss_example"
)
```

### 3. The new `severity_level` field in the code review prompt is not explained in detail.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/llms/prompts/code_review_prompts.py:100`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Clear documentation helps users understand how to use the severity level correctly.
💡 **Solution:** Add a brief explanation of what each severity level represents (e.g., what constitutes a level 1 vs. level 10 issue).

**Current Code:**
```python
For "severity_level" score in range of 1 to 10, 1 being not severe and 10 being critical.
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
For "severity_level" score in range of 1 to 10:
1-3: Minor issues (style, small optimizations)
4-6: Moderate issues (potential bugs, performance concerns)
7-8: Major issues (definite bugs, security vulnerabilities)
9-10: Critical issues (severe security risks, system-breaking bugs)
```
