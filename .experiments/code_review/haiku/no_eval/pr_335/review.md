<details>
<summary><strong>Prompt Changes (2 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The `PR_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT` and `PR_FILE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT` have been updated to use a more concise and structured format for the output.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/llms/prompts/pr_desc_prompts.py:1`
⚖️ **Severity:** 7/10

💡 **Solution:** The changes look good and should improve the overall quality and readability of the generated pull request descriptions.

📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:29`
⚖️ **Severity:** 7/10
🔍 **Description:** The `CODE_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT` was previously used as the system prompt for the code review process, but it has been replaced with a new prompt specifically for generating pull request descriptions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Removal of `PR_DESC_EVALUATION_PROMPT` (2 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The `PR_DESC_EVALUATION_PROMPT` has been removed from the `code_review_prompts.py` file.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/llms/prompts/code_review_prompts.py:190`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** The `PR_DESC_EVALUATION_PROMPT` was previously used for re-evaluating the generated pull request description, but it has been removed in the current changes.
