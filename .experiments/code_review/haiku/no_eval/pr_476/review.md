<details>
<summary><strong>Sorting PR Files (3 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The PR files are now being sorted before passing them to the description generator. This is a good improvement for maintaining consistent file order in the review.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:184`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Sorting the files ensures a consistent order in the review, making it easier for the reviewer to understand the changes.
💡 **Solution:** The `sort_files` function looks good and should effectively sort the files in alphabetical order.

### 2. The new `generate_tests` function is a good addition, as it provides a way to generate test cases based on the changed files in the PR.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:199`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Generating tests based on the PR files can help ensure the changes don't break existing functionality.
💡 **Solution:** The current implementation of `generate_tests` is simple and effective. It returns a list of file names, which can be used to create test cases.

### 3. The change to pass the `code_quality` parameter to the `create_pr_review_text` function is a good improvement, as it allows the review description to include information about the overall code quality.
📁 **File:** `examples/code_review/main.py:36`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Providing information about the code quality in the review description can give the developer a better understanding of the overall state of the codebase.
💡 **Solution:** The change looks good and should provide valuable information in the review description.

Additional small points that you might want to consider:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand (3 issues)</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Printing Diff and PR Files (3 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The changes in the `main.py` file to print the `diff_text` and `pr_files` are useful for debugging and understanding the input data.
📁 **File:** `examples/code_review/main.py:21`
⚖️ **Severity:** 3/10
🔍 **Description:** Printing the diff and PR files can help developers better understand the changes being reviewed.
💡 **Solution:** The changes look good and should provide helpful information during the review process.

### 2. The change to print the `review_data.issues` instead of the `topics` variable is an improvement, as it provides more detailed information about the identified issues.
📁 **File:** `examples/code_review/main.py:39`
⚖️ **Severity:** 3/10
🔍 **Description:** Printing the raw issues can give the developer a better understanding of the specific problems found during the review.
💡 **Solution:** The change looks good and should provide more useful information in the output.

### 3. The removal of the `enable_observability_logging` configuration option is a good cleanup, as it removes an unused feature from the configuration file.
📁 **File:** `config.json:4`
⚖️ **Severity:** 3/10
🔍 **Description:** Removing unused configuration options helps keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
💡 **Solution:** The change looks good and should help simplify the configuration file.
