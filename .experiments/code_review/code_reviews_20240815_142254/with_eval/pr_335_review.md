## 🚨 Critical Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Functionality (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Changing the method from 'chat_completion_with_json' to 'chat_completion' may alter expected behavior.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:83`
⚖️ **Severity:** 8/10
🔍 **Description:** If 'chat_completion_with_json' was designed to handle specific JSON formatting, switching to 'chat_completion' may lead to data handling issues.
💡 **Solution:** Review the implementation of 'chat_completion' to ensure it meets the requirements previously handled by 'chat_completion_with_json'.

**Current Code:**
```python
resp, usage = self.provider.chat_completion_with_json(prompt, user=user)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
resp, usage = self.provider.chat_completion(prompt, user=user)
```

## 🟠 Important Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Imports (3 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Updated import statements may lead to confusion regarding the source of prompts.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:8`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** Changing the import path for prompts can lead to issues if the new module does not contain the expected constants.
💡 **Solution:** Ensure that the new import path is correct and that all necessary constants are defined in the new module.

**Current Code:**
```python
from kaizen.llms.prompts.code_review_prompts import (
    PR_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT,
    MERGE_PR_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT,
    PR_FILE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT,
    PR_DESC_EVALUATION_PROMPT,
    CODE_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
)
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
from kaizen.llms.prompts.pr_desc_prompts import (
    PR_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT,
    MERGE_PR_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT,
    PR_FILE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT,
    PR_DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
)
```

### 2. Raising a generic Exception can obscure the cause of errors.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:51`
⚖️ **Severity:** 7/10
🔍 **Description:** Using a generic Exception does not provide specific information about the error, making debugging difficult.
💡 **Solution:** Use a more specific exception type or create a custom exception class to provide better context.

**Current Code:**
```python
raise Exception("Both diff_text and pull_request_files are empty!")
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
raise ValueError("Both diff_text and pull_request_files are empty!")
```

### 3. Removing 'reeval_response' from multiple function signatures may lead to loss of intended functionality.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/generator/pr_description.py:40`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** If 'reeval_response' was previously used to control logic, its removal could lead to unintended behavior.
💡 **Solution:** Carefully assess the logic that relies on 'reeval_response' to determine if it should be retained.

**Current Code:**
```python
def _process_full_diff(self, prompt: str, user: Optional[str], reeval_response: bool) -> str:
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
def _process_full_diff(self, prompt: str, user: Optional[str]) -> str:
```
