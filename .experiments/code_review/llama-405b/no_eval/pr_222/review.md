## 🚨 Critical Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Error handling (8 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Error handling is missing in some critical sections of the code.
📁 **File:** `:0`
⚖️ **Severity:** 8/10
🔍 **Description:** Error handling is crucial for preventing crashes and providing useful error messages.

**Suggested Code:**
```python
query = """SELECT ... FROM %s e""" % self.table_name
```

## 🟠 Refinement Suggestions:
These are not critical issues, but addressing them could further improve the code:

<details>
<summary><strong>Code organization (4 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The code is well-organized, but some files have too many responsibilities.
📁 **File:** `:0`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** Separation of concerns is crucial for maintainability.
💡 **Solution:** Consider breaking down large files into smaller ones.

### 2. Missing error handling for database operations
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/custom_vector_store.py:39`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Database operations can fail due to various reasons, and error handling is necessary to prevent crashes
💡 **Solution:** Add try-except blocks to handle database operation errors

### 3. The code does not handle potential errors that may occur when connecting to the database or executing queries.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/llama_index_retriever.py:250`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** Error handling is crucial to prevent the program from crashing and to provide meaningful error messages instead.
💡 **Solution:** Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors when connecting to the database or executing queries.

### 4. Catch specific exceptions in LanguageLoader.load_language
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/tree_sitter_utils.py:15`

## 📝 Minor Notes
Additional small points that you might want to consider:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand (7 issues)</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Type hints (7 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Type hints are missing in some function definitions.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/code_chunker.py:7`
⚖️ **Severity:** 3/10
🔍 **Description:** Type hints improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
💡 **Solution:** Add type hints for function parameters and return types.

**Current Code:**
```python
def chunk_code(code: str, language: str) -> ParsedBody:
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
def chunk_code(code: str, language: str) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
```

### 2. Some code is duplicated across multiple files.
📁 **File:** `:0`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Code duplication makes maintenance harder and increases the chance of bugs.
💡 **Solution:** Extract duplicated code into reusable functions or classes.

### 3. Missing type hints for function return types
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/custom_vector_store.py:13`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** Type hints improve code readability and help catch type-related errors
💡 **Solution:** Add type hints for function return types

### 4. AbstractionFeedback class has a single responsibility, but its methods are not well-organized
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/feedback_system.py:4`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** Well-organized code is easier to read and maintain
💡 **Solution:** Consider reorganizing the methods into separate classes or modules

### 5. The code has duplicated logic for storing code in the database and storing function relationships.
📁 **File:** `kaizen/retriever/llama_index_retriever.py:295`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
