## 🟠 Refinement Suggestions:
These are not critical issues, but addressing them could further improve the code:

<details>
<summary><strong>Functionality (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. The code seems to be implementing a memory creation feature with a dialog box. However, there are some potential issues with the functionality.
📁 **File:** `menu.tsx:213`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** The `handleSubmit` function is not properly handling errors. It should be improved to handle errors in a more robust way.
💡 **Solution:** Add try-catch blocks to handle errors in the `handleSubmit` function.

</details>

## 📝 Minor Notes
Additional small points that you might want to consider:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand (8 issues)</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Unused imports (5 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. There are several unused imports in the code, such as `redirect` in `page.tsx` and `Switch` and `Label` in `queryinput.tsx`. These imports should be removed to declutter the code.
📁 **File:** `page.tsx, queryinput.tsx:0`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** Unused imports can make the code harder to read and maintain.
💡 **Solution:** Remove unused imports.

### 2. Some variables and functions are missing type annotations, such as the `initialSpaces` prop in `queryinput.tsx`. Adding type annotations can improve code readability and prevent type-related errors.
📁 **File:** `queryinput.tsx:10`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** Type annotations can help catch type-related errors at compile-time.
💡 **Solution:** Add type annotations for variables and functions.

### 3. The code is not well-organized. There are many functions and variables defined inside the `DialogContentContainer` component.
📁 **File:** `menu.tsx:163`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** It would be better to separate the concerns of the component into smaller functions or utilities.
💡 **Solution:** Extract some of the functions and variables into separate files or utilities.

### 4. The import of `useEffect` from 'react' is not used in the code.
📁 **File:** `packages/ui/shadcn/combobox.tsx:3`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** The import is not used anywhere in the code.
💡 **Solution:** Remove the unused import.

### 5. The type annotation for the `handleInputChange` function is missing.
📁 **File:** `packages/ui/shadcn/combobox.tsx:41`
⚖️ **Severity:** 5/10
🔍 **Description:** The function is not annotated with a type.
💡 **Solution:** Add the type annotation for the function.

**Current Code:**
```python
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) =>{
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
const handleInputChange: React.ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement> = (e) =>{
```
