<summary><strong>Error Handling (1 issues)</strong></summary>

### 1. Broad exception handling can mask bugs and make debugging difficult.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:140`
⚖️ **Severity:** 6/10
🔍 **Description:** The `except Exception` block in `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py` (line 140) catches all exceptions, which can make it challenging to identify and fix specific issues.
💡 **Solution:** Catch specific exceptions that can occur during the execution of the code, and provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.

**Current Code:**
```python
except Exception:
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
```

### 1. The `sort_files` function is not necessary and can be replaced with a built-in sorting function.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:184`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** The `sort_files` function in `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py` (line 184) is not necessary and can be replaced with the built-in `sorted` function.
💡 **Solution:** Use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the files, which is more efficient and Pythonic.

**Current Code:**
```python
def sort_files(files):
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
sorted_files = sorted(files, key=lambda x: x['filename'])
```

### 2. The `generate_tests` function is not necessary and can be replaced with a list comprehension.
📁 **File:** `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py:199`
⚖️ **Severity:** 4/10
🔍 **Description:** The `generate_tests` function in `github_app/github_helper/pull_requests.py` (line 199) is not necessary and can be replaced with a list comprehension.
💡 **Solution:** Use a list comprehension to generate the tests, which is more efficient and Pythonic.

**Current Code:**
```python
def generate_tests(pr_files):
```

**Suggested Code:**
```python
tests =[f['filename'] for f in pr_files]
```
